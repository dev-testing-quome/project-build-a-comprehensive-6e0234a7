# Deployment Guide - project-build-a-comprehensive

This guide outlines the deployment process for "project-build-a-comprehensive," a legal case management system.  This is a high-level guide; specific commands and configurations will depend on your chosen technologies and cloud provider.  Replace placeholders like `<your-value>` with your actual values.


## Prerequisites

### Required Software and Tools

* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Git
* A cloud provider account (AWS, GCP, or Azure – choose one)
* A text editor or IDE
* A database client (e.g., pgAdmin for PostgreSQL)
* (Optional) Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) or Docker Swarm CLI

### System Requirements

* **Server:**  Minimum 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM, 50GB SSD storage (requirements will scale based on user load and data volume).
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (or your chosen database) – requirements depend on anticipated data volume.
* **Operating System:**  Linux (recommended) –  Specific distributions like Ubuntu or CentOS are suitable.


### Account Setup

1. **Cloud Provider:** Create an account with your chosen cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).  Set up billing and access keys.
2. **Database:** Create a cloud-based database instance (e.g., RDS on AWS, Cloud SQL on GCP, Azure Database for PostgreSQL). Note the connection string, username, and password.
3. **Other Services:** If using external services (e.g., payment gateway, court calendar API), create accounts and obtain necessary API keys and credentials.


## Environment Setup

### Environment Variables Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory with the following variables (adapt to your specific needs):

```
DATABASE_URL="<your_database_connection_string>"
DATABASE_USER="<your_database_user>"
DATABASE_PASSWORD="<your_database_password>"
API_KEY_PAYMENT_GATEWAY="<your_payment_gateway_api_key>"
COURT_CALENDAR_API_KEY="<your_court_calendar_api_key>"
SECRET_KEY="<your_application_secret_key>"  # For session management etc.
# ... other environment variables ...
```

**Important:**  Never hardcode sensitive information directly into your code.


### Database Setup

1. **Create Database:** Create the database instance as described in the "Account Setup" section.
2. **User Creation:** Create a database user with appropriate permissions.
3. **Database Migration:** (See "Database Setup" section below for details).


### External Service Configuration

Configure your application to connect with external services using the API keys and credentials obtained during account setup.  This will typically involve updating configuration files or environment variables.


## Docker Deployment

### Building the Docker Image

Navigate to your project's root directory and run:

```bash
docker build -t project-build-a-comprehensive .
```

This command assumes you have a `Dockerfile` in the root directory.  Adjust the tag (`project-build-a-comprehensive`) if needed.


### Running with Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file (example):

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"  # Adjust port as needed
    environment:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=<your_database_user>
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your_database_password>
      - POSTGRES_DB=<your_database_name>
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will build and start the application and database containers.


### Environment Configuration

The `.env` file is automatically loaded by the Docker Compose setup.  Ensure all necessary environment variables are set correctly.


### Health Checks and Monitoring

Implement health checks within your application to monitor its status.  Use Docker Compose's healthcheck option in `docker-compose.yml` or a separate monitoring tool.


## Production Deployment

### Cloud Deployment Options

* **AWS:** Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or EKS for deploying Docker containers.
* **GCP:** Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Cloud Run.
* **Azure:** Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Instances (ACI).

Choose the option that best fits your needs and technical expertise.


### Container Orchestration

* **Kubernetes:**  Deploy your application as Kubernetes pods using YAML manifests.  This allows for scaling and managing containers effectively.
* **Docker Swarm:**  A simpler container orchestration solution, suitable for smaller deployments.

### Load Balancing and Scaling

Configure a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancing, GCP Cloud Load Balancing, Azure Load Balancer) to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application.  Implement auto-scaling based on resource utilization.


### SSL/TLS Configuration

Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., Let's Encrypt) and configure your load balancer or web server to use HTTPS.


## Database Setup

### Database Migration Commands

Use a migration tool (e.g., Alembic for Python) to manage database schema changes.  Apply migrations after deployment:

```bash
alembic upgrade head  # Example using Alembic
```


### Initial Data Setup

Create scripts to populate the database with initial data, such as user roles, default settings, etc.  Run these scripts after the database migration.


### Backup and Recovery Procedures

Implement regular database backups using your cloud provider's tools or dedicated backup solutions.  Establish a recovery procedure to restore the database from backups in case of failure.


## Monitoring & Logging

### Application Monitoring Setup

Use a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) to monitor application health, resource usage, and performance metrics.


### Log Aggregation

Collect logs from all application components using a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk).


### Performance Monitoring

Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response times, error rates, and throughput.  Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.


### Error Tracking

Implement error tracking (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to capture and analyze application errors.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

* **Database connection errors:** Verify database credentials and connection string.
* **Port conflicts:** Ensure that ports are not already in use.
* **Missing dependencies:** Check that all required libraries and packages are installed.


### Debug Commands

* `docker logs <container_name>`: View container logs.
* `docker exec -it <container_name> bash`: Access a running container's shell for debugging.


### Log Locations

Log locations will vary depending on your application's logging configuration.  Refer to your application's documentation.


### Recovery Procedures

Establish procedures for recovering from failures, including database restoration and application restart.


## Security Considerations

### Environment Variable Security

Do not commit sensitive environment variables to version control.  Use a secure secret management system (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault).


### Network Security

Configure firewalls to restrict access to your application and database.  Use VPNs or other security measures to protect your network.


### Authentication Setup

Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access.


### Regular Security Updates

Keep your application, dependencies, and operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches.
